# CS 250: Essential Questions Reflection

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs requires establishing a continuous feedback loop with the Product Owner rather than relying on static, upfront assumptions. Creating "user stories" is a key to this process because it shifts the engineering focus away from technical "jargon" and places it directly on the value being delivered to the end user. By defining strict acceptance criteria within a user story, I can ensure I am building exactly what the client needs, such as clarifying whether a slideshow interface should loop or stop, before I write a single line of code.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach software development iteratively, breaking monolithic projects down into manageable, testable increments. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate timeboxed Sprints and collaborative estimation techniques like Planning Poker into my workflows. Having experienced a project that missed critical launch dates due to chained, rigid dependencies, I know that using these Agile processes will help me realistically gauge complexity and set honest delivery expectations with stakeholders.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means prioritizing transparent communication and collective ownership over individual heroics. It involves making work highly visible, such as utilizing information radiators to highlight when a task is stuck, so the team can "swarm" blockers together rather than hiding struggles. Most imporantly, it means leaving ego at the door, actively incorporating feedback from peers, and ensuring that every contribution serves the goals of the sprint.
